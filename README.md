# WallBall

WallBall was a class project created by James Etten, Michael Schmidt, and
Brady Dow in 2017 at UW - Platteville. 

It was originally built in NetBeans, so there are no maven or gradle build
files allowing for CI building. If the mood presents itself I may revisit
this project and get it building again.
